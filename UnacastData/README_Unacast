This data is an abridged version of their full data and is not updated regularily, but this allows you to see what it looks like so you get a sense of what they can provide for you.

As a non-profit, they were willing to provide their full data for the COVID-19 map to us without charge. But we are unable to share that publically.

If you reach out to Unacast and get permission from Unacast for us to share the data with you, we are happy to give you access to our files that we have formatted to math the other data in this repo.
