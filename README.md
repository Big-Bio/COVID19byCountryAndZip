# Relevant Data

* [CDCâ€™s Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)](https://nation.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=425652f366d34c8ca33e6b014a304054): It includes all kinds of columns on the tract/county level including a social vulnerability score (calculated from 15 US Census metrics), data on population, housing stats, unemployment, poverty, per capita income, etc.


* [nytimes' case counts data](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data): Here the nytimes is gathering all the state and county case and death counts. Data is kept up to date and each county entry (or state entry) uses the corresponding FIPS code.

# Static Data

In this [folder](https://github.com/Big-Bio/COVID19byZip/tree/master/StaticData) we are hoping to make machine readable flat files of static covariates that can be used to understand disease spread and severity rates. We want all covariates to be at the zip and county code level of granularity.  We want any data on covariates that could indicate [risk](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html) and any covariates that we think might be correlated with these or with other measures of social distancing.
