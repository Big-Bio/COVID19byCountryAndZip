  * Description: The labor force includes all people in the civilian labor force (employed or unemployed) and U.S. Armed forces. The American Community Survey (ACS) asks questions about family relationships and employment status to gather data about household interactions. These datasets include several columns regarding parental labor status, such as children under age 6 having both parents, no parents, or only mother/only father in the labor force. See the [ACS topics](https://www.census.gov/acs/www/about/why-we-ask-each-question/index.php) or [data pages](https://www.census.gov/acs/www/data/data-tables-and-tools/) for more details.

  * Description: The ACS gathers data about grandparent caregivers. These datasets include information about children under 18 living with Grandparents. Various columns split children into age ranges (e.g. Grandchildren under age 6 living with a Grandparent), or describe if a grandparent is responsible for a child, with or without a parent present. This data is available at the tract, county, and state level. See the [ACS topics](https://www.census.gov/acs/www/about/why-we-ask-each-question/index.php) or [data pages](https://www.census.gov/acs/www/data/data-tables-and-tools/) for more details.

[ACS_Disability_Status by State](tract_county_state/ACS_Disability_Status_Variables_Centroids_byState.csv)<br />
  * Description: The ACS gathers data about a person's difficulty with tasks in order to create statistics about disability. The U.S. Census Bureau [defines](https://www.census.gov/glossary/#term_Disability) disability as "a long-lasting physical, mental, or emotional condition." These datasets include columns that count disability status in population groups divided by gender and age range, as well as percentages of people with disabilities in a given population (e.g. Percent of Female Population with a disability). This data is available at the tract, state, and county level. See the [ACS topics](https://www.census.gov/acs/www/about/why-we-ask-each-question/index.php) or [data pages](https://www.census.gov/acs/www/data/data-tables-and-tools/) for more details.

[ACS_Health_Insurance_Coverage_Variables by State](tract_county_state/ACS_Health_Insurance_Coverage_Variables_Centroids_byState.csv)<br />
  * Description: The ACS gathers data about health insurance coverage and the sources of health insurance in a given geographic area. These datasets include estimates of number of individuals in varying demographic groups with different health care plans, such as those with Medicaid, Medicare, direct-purchase healthcare, military healthcare, etc. Additionally, the datasets have columns specifying populations which have more than one type of health insurance coverage, only one health insurance coverage, or no health insurance coverage (e.g. Population Under 19 Years with no health insurance coverage). This data is available at the tract, state, and county level. See the [ACS topics](https://www.census.gov/acs/www/about/why-we-ask-each-question/index.php) or [data pages](https://www.census.gov/acs/www/data/data-tables-and-tools/) for more details.

  *  Description: Social vulnerability refers to the resilience of communities when confronted by external stresses on human health, stresses such as natural or human-caused disasters, or disease outbreaks. CDC's Social Vulnerability Index uses 15 U.S. census variables at tract level to help local officials identify communities that may need support in preparing for hazards; or recovering from disaster. The dataset includes several columns besides the index, such as population by age, poverty, unemployment,income, housing statistics, and more. See [the full documentation](https://svi.cdc.gov/Documents/Data/2018_SVI_Data/SVI2018Documentation.pdf) for details.
